# DokanNet.Tardigrade
 A Dokany-Wrapper to access Storj/Tardigrade as a Windows-Drive

The wrapper is currently under development but should work already. You have to provide the satellite-address, the API key, the encryption passphrase and the bucket name in this order to the console-application. The drive would then mount on drive s with the name "Tardigrade".

This is currently work in progress and contains no error handling and such. Use at your own risk!
