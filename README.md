# DokanNet.Tardigrade
A Dokany-Wrapper to access Storj/Tardigrade as a Windows-Drive

This is the source-code for the "Tardigrade-Drive"-App available in the Windows Store. It enables you to mount one or more storj-buckets as a virtual harddrive in you explorer. You may compile it for yourself or get the version from the store. For this app to work you must have Dokany installed (which you can get [here](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases)).
